<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![projectCircleAgency](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36738579/181576736-54be0896-bf13-40ad-86e6-f12bb444d5c6.png)

#### Introduction to the Mid-term project
In this project, you’re going to be building and deploying your first fully responsive website using the technologies you’ve learned so far: HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

Later in the course, you’re going to learn how to create more complex web applications using Vue.js on top of JavaScript. However, it’s important that you practice the basic coding skills you’ve learned so far before moving on to more complex tasks.


#### Technical Requirements
Your website should be rendered in a browser.
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files.
Have a repo on GitHub.
Have at least 1 commit per day that you worked on it.
Be deployed online using Netlify so that anybody can access it.
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.
In summary, for this project, you’ll have to recreate a pre-existing design using your HTML & CSS skills. You’ll also have to create a few interactions with the DOM, using what you’ve learned about JavaScript so far.

Finally, you’ll have to deploy this project to Netlify, using the Git CLI to do so. When you’re finished, you’ll have your first website live and ready for anyone to interact with it!


#### Deliverables
The URL of the GitHub repository for your project.
The URL of the live website on the Internet.
The URL of the slides for your project presentation.
You must present your project during Mid-term final presentations
